```
==============================
🏠 HOUSE PRICE PREDICTOR APP
==============================

📌 Project Overview
-------------------
This project is a Machine Learning-based web application developed using Streamlit.
The app predicts house prices based on user inputs like quality, area, garage capacity,
age of the house, and more.

The backend model is trained using Gradient Boosting Regressor with hyperparameter tuning.
Feature engineering techniques are used to enhance prediction accuracy.

📦 Features
----------
✅ Gradient Boosting Regressor with Hyperparameter Tuning  
✅ Feature Engineering (HouseAge, GarageAge, TotalBathrooms, etc.)  
✅ Lightweight, Fast & Modern UI  
✅ Real-time Prediction with User Inputs  
✅ Clean Crystal-like Visual UI (Streamlit-based)

⚙️ Feature Engineering
---------------------
New Features Created:
- HouseAge = YrSold - YearBuilt  
- YearsSinceRemodel = YrSold - YearRemodAdd  
- GarageAge = YrSold - GarageYrBlt  
- TotalBathrooms = FullBath + BsmtFullBath + 0.5 * (HalfBath + BsmtHalfBath)  
- TotalSF = TotalBsmtSF + 1stFlrSF + 2ndFlrSF

Final Selected Features:
- OverallQual  
- GrLivArea  
- GarageCars  
- TotalBathrooms  
- TotalSF  
- HouseAge  
- GarageAge  
- YearsSinceRemodel
