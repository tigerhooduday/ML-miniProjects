Final Probability:   ✅ VITERBI ALGORITHM (Decoding  Problem) 🎯 Goal:   Find the most proba ble sequence of states for a given observation. 👇 Observation:   O = [walk, shop, clean] Let’s calcu late the most probable path . Step-by-step (Viterbi)   Let δₜ(i) = max probability of any path that ends in state i at time t  Let ψₜ(i) = argmax path taken to reach state i at time t Initialization:  t = 2 P(O | λ) = α ₃(Rainy) + α ₃(Sunny) = 0.02904 + 0.004572 = **0.033612** δ₁(Rainy) = π(Rainy) × B(Rainy, walk) = 0.6 × 0.1 = 0.06   δ₁(Sunny) = π(Sunny) × B(Sunny, walk) = 0.4 × 0.6 = 0.24   ψ₁(Rainy) = ψ ₁(Sunny) = 0 (no previous)

🔷 State Transition Diagram    Each arrow  has a transition probability on it. 🔶 Summary    A Markov Model is based on the Markov property  (future depends only on present). Markov Chains : All states are visib le. HMMs : States are hidden, and each state emits visible outputs. They are used in: Speech recognition Weather prediction DNA  sequence analysis POS taggi ng Finance     Absolutely , here are complete in-depth notes  on Markov Models , including : ✅ Marko v Property ✅ Marko v Chains and Transition Matr ix

✅ FORWARD ALGORITHM (Evaluation  Problem) 🎯 Goal:   Calculate probability of a sequence:  P(O | λ) = probability that model λ gene rated the observation sequence O. 👇 Observation:   O = [walk, shop, clean] Let’s compute P(O | λ) using Forward Algorithm : Step-by-Step (T = 3)   Let αₜ(i) = P(observa tions up to time t and state i at time t) Initialization (t = 1)  Induction (t = 2)  Induction (t = 3) α₁(Rainy) = π(Rainy) × B(Rainy, walk) = 0.6 × 0.1 = 0.06   α₁(Sunny) = π(Sunny) × B(Sunny, walk) = 0.4 × 0.6 = 0.24 α₂(Rainy) = [ α ₁(Rainy) × A(Rainy→Rainy) + α ₁(Sunny) × A(Sunny→Rainy)] ×  B(Rainy, shop)             = [0.06 × 0.7 + 0.24 × 0.4] × 0.4             = (0.042 + 0.096) × 0.4 = 0.138 × 0.4 = 0.0552 α₂(Sunny) = [0.06 × 0.3 + 0.24 × 0.6] × 0.3             = (0.018 + 0.144) × 0.3 = 0.162 × 0.3 = 0.0486 α₃(Rainy) = [0.0552 × 0.7 + 0.0486 × 0.4] × 0.5             = (0.03864 + 0.01944) × 0.5 = 0.05808 × 0.5 = 0.02904 α₃(Sunny) = [0.0552 × 0.3 + 0.0486 × 0.6] × 0.1             = (0.016
